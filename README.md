# Code Maestro Comparative Testing

## Overview

This project provides an automated system for comparing the performance of [Code Maestro](https://www.codemaestro.ai/) with other AI assistants. It allows users to analyze different AI models responses in a structured and reproducible way.

## Contribute to the Project

We welcome contributions from the community! You can:

- Add your own projects for evaluation
- Submit new use cases for testing
- Create and integrate new assistant scripts

Starting from the next release, we will regularly run these tests and publish the results.

## Available Projects

The current set of projects includes:

- **Darklings Fighting Game** – Crossplatform 2D fighting game with networking
- **ECS Racing Sample** – Online racing game
- More projects coming soon!

## How to Add a Project

To submit your project for testing, [please contact us](https://www.codemaestro.ai/contact)! We'll be happy to hear from you.

## Command Line Arguments

The project provides command-line utilities to execute tests and manage use cases:

### Comparison Script:

- `-input <path>`: Specifies the directory containing input files (default: `./input`).
- `-output <path>`: Specifies the directory where outputs will be stored (default: `./output`).
- `-assistants <list>`: Specifies which assistant scripts to run (default: runs all assistants).

**Example Usage:**

```sh
python compare.py -input ./input/navigation -output ./output -assistants code-maestro
```

To run the script with the CodeMaestro assistant it is required to provide valid credentials in the `assitants/code-maestro.py`.

## Viewing and Adding Use Cases

- Existing test cases are stored in the `/input/` directory.
- Use case files should follow the `.ini` format and be placed under the appropriate category (e.g., `/input/navigation/`).
- **Format of a use case file (********`.ini`********)**:
  ```ini
  [Repository]
  Name=<Project Name>
  URL=https://github.com/kidagine/Darklings-FightingGame.git

  [Input]
  <User input sent to the assistant>

  [Input]
  <Optional follow-up question>

  [Evaluator]
  <Criteria for evaluating the response>
  ```
- Example:
  ```ini
  [Repository]
  Name=Darklings-FightingGame
  URL=https://github.com/kidagine/Darklings-FightingGame.git

  [Input]
  What types of image compression are used in the project?

  [Input]
  Can you inspect meta files for such images and list the types of image compression used in the project?

  [Evaluator]
  Provides concrete types of image compression used in the project.
  ```

The project name is required for the Code Maestro and can be obtained from our sales team for almost any public repository you'd like to see here.

## Writing and Adding an Assistant Script

To integrate a new assistant:

1. Write a Python script inside the `assistants/` directory.
2. Implement a `run(input_data)` function that processes structured input data and returns a dictionary containing user inputs and corresponding assistant responses.
3. Ensure the script follows the API call format as demonstrated in `code-maestro.py`.
4. Test your assistant script using `compare.py` before submitting.

### Accepts

- `inputs` (list): A list of user inputs, including follow-ups.
- `project_name` (str): The name of the project being queried.

### Returns

- `user_inputs` (list): A list of user inputs that were processed.
- `assistant_responses` (list): Corresponding responses generated by the assistant.

### Example structure of an assistant script:

```python
def run(input_data):
    """Processes user input and returns the assistant response."""
    responses = []
    for user_input in input_data["inputs"]:
        response = f"Fake response for: {user_input}"
        responses.append(response)
    return {
        "user_inputs": input_data["inputs"],
        "assistant_responses": responses
    }
```

## How to Create a Pull Request

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch with your feature or fix.
3. Make your changes and commit them.
4. Test your assistant script using compare.py before submitting.
5. Push the branch and create a pull request.
