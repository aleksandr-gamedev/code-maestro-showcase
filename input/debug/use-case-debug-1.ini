        public void OnUpdate(ref SystemState state)
        {
            var id = GetSingleton<NetworkId>();
            var ecb = new EntityCommandBuffer(Allocator.TempJob);
            foreach (var player in Query<PlayerAspect>())
            {
                if (player.NetworkId == id.Value)
                {
                    ecb.AddComponent<LocalUser>(player.Self);
                }
            }

            ecb.Playback(state.EntityManager);
        }

Fix all of the errors in this code:
- LocalUser component is added multiple times
- present memory leak
