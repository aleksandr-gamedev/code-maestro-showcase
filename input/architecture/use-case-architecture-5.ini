[Input]
I have a feature to implement in this game:

**Twitch chat integration**: I want viewers to be able to send in-game messages, which will appear above the player’s or the AI opponent’s head during the game as if they were saying them.

**Full list of requirements:**

1. **Message Format**: Messages will appear as text bubbles above the character. The message length will be limited to 128 characters (this must be configurable).  
2. **Message Triggers**: Messages from the chat containing the AI's or player's character name will be collected into corresponding lists and triggered when the opponent character is downed or loses the match. After a message is triggered, the list for that character will be cleared.  
3. **Message Duration**: Messages will stay visible for 3 seconds (this must be configurable).  
4. **Character Targeting**: To target a character, a message must start with the character’s name followed by a colon (e.g., "Player1: Nice shot!").  
5. **Twitch Authentication**: The game will authenticate with Twitch using the player’s OAuth tokens. Messages will be selected from the authenticated player’s active stream, if available.  
6. **Replay**: Selected and displayed messages will be saved and visible during the match replay.  
7. **Network Synchronization**: The message lists are NOT subject to network synchronization. If both players are authenticated and streaming two different streams, messages will be selected from both chats on both clients. If only one player is authenticated, then the messages will appear only for this player and be saved only for their replay. If one player bans another from their chat, then messages will be selected from one chat only.

Complete the following subtask for this feature:

### Subtask 1: Twitch Authentication Setup
Create a system that authenticates the game with Twitch using the player’s OAuth tokens. The system should connect to the Twitch API and ensure it can access the authenticated player’s chat messages.
