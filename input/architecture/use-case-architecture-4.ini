[Input]
I need to implement a new feature in this game. Here’s the description:

-   Twitch stream viewers should be able to send in-game messages. These messages will appear above either the player’s or the opponent’s (AI or another player) head during the game, as if they were speaking.

Please analyze the repository and player loops, and provide a minimal list of critical concerns from both a game design and a programming perspective I MUST address before implementing this feature. 

The format for the answer MUST be:

- **<Concern #1 name>**: < example resolution for concern #1>
- **<Concern #2 name>**: < example resolution for concern #2>
...
- **<Concern #N name>**: < example resolution for concern #N>

Be clear and laconic.
