[Input]
How is AI behavior defined for the opponent characters? Are there specific scripts or tools used to manage AI logic?


[Evaluator]
Answer is based on BrainController and CpuController classes. If not, the rest is irrelevant.
There should be a clear explanation of how the AI makes decisions, including how it handles movement, attacks, and special actions based on conditions like player proximity and random factors.
The response should address how the AI logic is deterministic, ensuring consistent behavior across different game instances, which is crucial for networked play.
The explanation should be clear, concise, and technical, suitable for someone familiar with Unity and game development concepts.
